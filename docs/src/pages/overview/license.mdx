Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, Woolworths Limited (“Woolworths”) grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, and non-exclusive license to use the Woolworths Design Guidelines (“Collabur DS”) solely in connection with creating, testing, and distributing plugins, extensions, add-ons or other software products or services that interoperate or are integrated with Woolworths’s software and hosted products (“Add-Ons”).
  2. <strong>License Restrictions</strong>. You may not use the Collabur DS for any purpose not expressly permitted by this License Agreement. You may not modify, adapt, redistribute, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or create derivative works of the Collabur DS or any part of the Collabur DS.
  3. <strong>IP Ownership</strong>. You agree that Woolworths or third parties own all legal right, title and interest in and to the Collabur DS, including any Intellectual Property Rights that subsist in the Collabur DS. “<strong>Intellectual Property Rights</strong>” means any and all rights under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other proprietary rights.
