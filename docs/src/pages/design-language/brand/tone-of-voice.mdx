  # Tone of voice

  <div class="docs-subtitle">
    While our tone may vary depending on the audience, channel and context, our voice should always be consistent with the Woolworths brand essence.
  </div>

  ## Attributes

  #### 1. We are benefit led

  Whatâ€™s in it for the member, not how good we think it is.

  #### 2. We are concise
  Use of short, snappy sentences keep it energetic and easy to understand.

  #### 3. We are conversational
  We are talking to real people. How would you explain this to a friend?

  ## Formal vs Informal
  The degree of formality will varies depending on the intended target and context. Conversations with our members are generally informal in their tone, while we adopt a slightly more formal tone in our communications with partners, and even more so within our corporate communications.
